#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int x;
    cin>>x;
    // if(x%2==0) cout<<"even";
    // else cout<<"odd";
    (x%2==0)? cout<<"even" : cout<<"odd";//this is ternary oper which is useless as we can do any code without this by using if else only also ye cool banne k liye hai or says in do a single line.
    //condition ? true: false  
}
